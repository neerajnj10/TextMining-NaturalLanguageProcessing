# TextMining-NaturalLanguageProcessing

*Text mining (TM) is the process that encapsulates the data/text extraction from unstructured format to discovering knowledge that was previously unknown*

Text mining is a burgeoning new field that attempts to glean meaningful information from natural
language text. It may be loosely characterized as the process of analyzing text to extract
information that is useful for particular purposes. Compared with the kind of data stored in
databases, text is unstructured, amorphous, and difficult to deal with algorithmically. Nevertheless,
in modern culture, text is the most common vehicle for the formal exchange of information. The
field of text mining usually deals with texts whose function is the communication of factual
information or opinions, and the motivation for trying to  extract information from such text
automatically is compellingâ€”even if success is only partial.

Natural language processing (NLP) is the ability of a computer program to understand human speech as it is spoken. NLP is a component of artificial intelligence (AI).
Current approaches to NLP are based on machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence that examines and uses patterns in data to improve a program's own understanding. Most of the research being done on natural language processing revolves around search, especially enterprise search.

Common NLP tasks in software programs today include:

-Sentence segmentation, part-of-speech tagging and parsing.
-Deep analytics.
-Named entity extraction.
-Co-reference resolution.

> TM & NLP are basically same however Text Mining is more recent, and uses techniques primarily developed in the fields of information retrieval, statistics, and machine learning. Its aim typically is not to understand all or even a large part of what a given speaker/writer has said, but rather to extract patterns across a large number of documents. 


##In this reporsitory we discuss some usefulness and applications of (TM/NLP)these concepts.
